Payment status change
=====================

This event means that the status of a payment has changed. To reduce noise, we only include status changes that occur after the user interaction has finished and are linked to a form submission. Status changes may also include additional information from the payment provider (e.g., transaction IDs). This usually means that the payment has either succeeded or failed. Note that after a payment fails, the user might choose to retry, which will yield more status changes for the same payment.

For each payment method, there are typical status sequences that the payment goes through. The exact meaning of the statuses and content of the ``payment_data`` also depends on the payment method.


Payment statuses
----------------

Here is a list of the most common payment statuses used in Impact Stack 1.0.

- ``payment_status_success``: The payment was successfully processed. The donation form was submitted and the supporter was redirected to the thank you page.
- ``payment_status_failed``: Something went wrong during the payment.
- ``payment_status_new``: The payment process was (re)started reusing the same form submission.
- ``payment_status_pending``: The payment is being processed by the payment provider.

For Stripe there are a few additional statuses:

- ``stripe_payment_status_accepted``: Our backend was notified that Stripe validated and approved the payment. The form submission is continued which triggers the ``payment_status_success`` status. These two statuses usually occur almost at the same time and might be emitted in any order.
- ``stripe_payment_intent_created``: This means that the client-side validation has been triggered for the first time, triggering the creation of an intent.
- ``stripe_payment_no_intent``: Error condition. This means Stripe notified us about a payment for which we donâ€™t have a matching intent.
